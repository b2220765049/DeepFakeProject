This repository contains the code and research for the "DeepFake Detection" project, part of the BBM479 Design Project at Hacettepe University. The primary goal of this research is to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of various state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for detecting deepfake videos.

## Project Overview

Deepfake technology poses a significant threat to the integrity of digital media. This project tackles the challenge by providing a comprehensive comparison of different model architectures, including standard 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs for temporal analysis, and modern Vision Transformers. We analyze their performance, robustness to perturbations, and ability to generalize to unseen datasets.

## Key Findings

*   **Transformer Architectures Excel:** Vision Transformer-based models like Swin-S and ViT-16 generally outperformed traditional CNNs, especially in cross-dataset evaluations.
*   **Frame Count is Critical:** Increasing the number of frames per video from 5 to 30 was the most significant factor in boosting model accuracy.
*   **Cross-Dataset Performance Drop:** All models showed a notable decrease in performance on unseen datasets (Celeb-DF), highlighting a significant generalization challenge.
*   **Vulnerability to Perturbations:** The models lacked robustness against common data perturbations like blur, noise, and compression artifacts.
*   **Limited Data Augmentation:** The minimal use of augmentation, while boosting metrics on the test set, likely contributed to overfitting and poor resilience against perturbations.

## Models Evaluated

We implemented and tested a wide range of models to compare their effectiveness:

*   **2D CNNs:**
    *   XceptionNet
    *   EfficientNet
    *   ResNet50
    *   ConvNeXt-S
*   **3D CNNs (Temporal Models):**
    *   Slow-ResNet
    *   r3d_18
    *   Custom 3D ResNet
*   **Transformer-based Models:**
    *   ViT-16 (Vision Transformer)
    *   Swin-S (Swin Transformer)

## Datasets

This project primarily uses the following publicly available datasets:

1.  **[FaceForensics++ (FF++)](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)**: Used for training and initial testing. It includes original videos and manipulated videos created with four different deepfake methods.
2.  **[Celeb-DF (v2)](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics)**: Used for cross-dataset evaluation to test the models' generalization capabilities on unseen data.

Please download the datasets from their official sources and organize them as described in the setup section.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *You should create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary libraries (e.g., PyTorch, torchvision, OpenCV, scikit-learn, etc.).*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Organize Datasets:**
    Create a `datasets/` directory in the project root and place the datasets inside, following a structure that your data loader scripts expect. For example:
    ```
    datasets/
    ├── faceforensics/
    │   ├── original_sequences/
    │   └── manipulated_sequences/
    └── celeb-df/
        ├── Celeb-real/
        └── Celeb-synthesis/
    ```

## Usage

We provide simple scripts to train new models and test existing ones.

### Training a Model

Use the `train.py` script to train a model. You can specify the model architecture, dataset path, and other hyperparameters.

**Example:**
```bash
python train.py \
    --model xception \
    --dataset_path ./datasets/faceforensics/ \
    --frames 30 \
    --epochs 20 \
    --batch_size 32 \
    --learning_rate 0.001 \
    --save_path ./checkpoints/
```

### Testing a Model

Use the `test.py` script to evaluate a trained model on a test set. You must provide the path to the saved model weights.

**Example:**
```bash
python test.py \
    --model xception \
    --weights_path ./checkpoints/xception_best.pth \
    --dataset_path ./datasets/celeb-df/ \
    --frames 30 \
    --batch_size 32
```

## Results

Our most comprehensive results come from the cross-dataset evaluation, where models were trained on FaceForensics++ and tested on Celeb-DF. The ROC AUC Score is the most reliable metric due to class imbalance.

| Model                  | Test Accuracy (%) | ROC AUC Score  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 3D ResNet              | 81.16             | 0.7923         |
| Xception               | 71.88             | 0.8041         |
| 3D ResNet + Transformer| 79.02             | 0.7521         |
| Xception + Transformer | 63.90             | 0.7489         |
| ViT-16                 | 78.49             | 0.8512         |
| ConvNeXt-S             | 76.92             | 0.8255         |
| **Swin-S**             | **78.35**         | **0.8533**     |

As shown, the **Swin-S Transformer** achieved the best generalization performance.

## Future Work

*   **Improve 3D CNNs:** Re-evaluate 3D CNNs with the expanded 30-frame dataset to better leverage temporal information.
*   **Integrate Advanced Temporal Models:** Explore architectures like Fully Temporal Convolutional Networks (FTCNs).
*   **Enhance Robustness:** Focus on targeted data augmentation techniques to improve model resilience against perturbations and enhance generalization.
*   **Expand Dataset Diversity:** Train and test on a wider variety of deepfake datasets to build a more universal detector.
